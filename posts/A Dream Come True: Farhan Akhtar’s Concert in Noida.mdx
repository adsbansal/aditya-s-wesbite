# Farhan Akhtarâ€™s Concert

Attending Farhan Akhtar's concert was a mind-numbing dream come true for me. 
Watching him perform has been a childhood aspiration, and to witness it unfold was surreal. 
For me, he is the perfect artist â€” a musician who sings and composes relatable songs that live in my mind rent-free, 
an actor and director whose movies and roles have inspired me since childhood and continue to do so. 
Finally, a poet who brings forth the finest work, both his own and that of those around him.

Farhan Akhtarâ€™s music is my go-to soundtrack for long, unwinding drives, alongside the iconic albums of his films. The poetry he brought forth in ZNMD has always been a north star in high and low times.  

One of the most humbling and motivating highlights of the concert was when Farhan paused midway to talk about *MARD*â€”an initiative raising social awareness against rape and discrimination of women. He left the audience spellbound as he recited the profound poem by Javed Akhtar.
Farhan Akhtar isnâ€™t just an artist for me; heâ€™s a timeless inspiration. He is the dude I've seen countless times in Dil Chahta Hai, Rock On!!, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Dil Dhadakne Do. 

The tickets were reasonably priced and the crowd was managable which made the experience worth x10 more. Also, If you want to experience somethine similar - [Thank Me Later!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU57mZ7i2I)

MARD. 
A poem by Javed Akhtar.  

Jiski aankhon mein hai jagmagati hui jaise gehri sharaafat ki ik roshni    
Jis ke andaz mein ek tehzeeb hai    
Jis ke lehjay mein narmi hai    
shabdon mein tameez hai     
Jis ke dil mein bhi aur jis ki baton mein bhi    
aurat ke vastay poori izzat bhi hai poora aadar bhi hai    
Jis ko aurat ke tan man ka, jeevan ka sammaan hai    
Aurat ke aatm-sammaan ka jisko har ek pal dhyaan hai    
Jo kabhi ek pal bhi nahin bhoolta  aurat  insaan hai     
Jis ko apni bhi pehchaan hai    
Jis mein shakti bhi hai   
Jis mein himmat bhi hai   
Jismein Gaurav hai, aatm-Vishwas hai   
Jo agar saath hai    
Jo agar paas hai    
Uske hone se aurat ko apni suraksha ka ehsaas hai    
Wo jo aurat ka ek sacha saathi hai, Ik dost hai, Ek hamdard hai     
Sach Toh ye hai    
vohi mard hain
