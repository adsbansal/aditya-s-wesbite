# One of the best narrative poems.

‘The Road Not Taken’ by Robert Frost in my opinion is one of the best narrative poems ever to be written. Having being first published in 1916, the literary piece still remains relevant and timeless a century later. 

If you haven’t read the poem or have a shady memory of it you can go through it by [going here](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken).

I was first introduced to the poem in when I was in 8th or 9th. It was something I appreciated instantly but never really comprehended.  

Sometime later now, I do have my interpretation of it. Also for the longest time I couldn’t understand a simple yet important concept used by creatives. Art can be interpreted in multiple ways, that is the beauty of it.  

Decision making is fundamental to life, just like how a river keeps flowing. It is something you cannot escape like paying taxes. This poem is equally relevant for all kinds of decisions big and small.  

Here are some inferences that I have taken away from this work of Frost’s. I hope you too are able to relate to them.

- You can never fully and completely know the repercussions of a decision. There is only so much that you can analyse it and look down it’s path. Either way you are going to have to take a leap of faith.
- Your decision are yours and yours only. No one is in the same predicament as you are and the best person to take decisions in your shoes is you. Intuition is nothing but the first thought that pops into your mind while deciding.
- Just like roads and trees, decisions keep branching out endlessly. It always helps to stop once a while and look around.
- All decisions have subtle differences between them and even though they might have different repercussions they often look the same.
- It doesn’t matter what decision we make, in the end we rewrite our own always rewrite our own histories to justify the decisions we make.
- And perhaps one of the best things I now realise out of this poem is the fact that life is a combination of a billion decisions!

I’m pretty sure, if my 9th grade English Literature teacher were to read this, she’d still be disappointed by interpretation of the poem xD

The funny part is even after all this deliberation you’d think I’ve gotten better at decision making but I assure you that is not the case!

While writing this blog I pondered about Robert Frost writing a poem on taxes. Just like everyone these days, I put up the question to ChatGPT and the answer was hilarious!

- The Poem
    
    In springtime's thaw, when snow recedes,
    And robins sing amongst the trees,
    We find ourselves amidst a chore
    That few can love, and all abhor.
    
    For with the melting of the ice,
    Comes a reckoning, not so nice,
    As we tally up our gains and losses,
    And pay the cost of roads and bridges.
    
    Our taxes, like a bitter pill,
    We swallow down with scant goodwill,
    But know that they are vital still,
    To keep our country running well.
    
    And so we file our forms with care,
    And send our checks off through the air,
    With sighs and grumbles, and a prayer,
    That next year's bill will be more fair.
    
    For taxes, like the springtime rain,
    Are necessary for our gain,
    And though we may not like the pain,
    We'll pay them all the same.
